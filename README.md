**This repository contains all the machine learning projects that I have done while learning machine learning concepts.**

My individual projects, including datasets, Flask applications, and APIs, are available here. Some projects are applicable with Docker.

## List of Projects
* Logistic regression model tries to predict the price of a given car.
* Credit scoring uses decision tree algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting to predict if the customer is likely to pay off  the debt.
